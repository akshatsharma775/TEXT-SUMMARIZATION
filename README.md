# TEXT-SUMMARIZATION
In today's information-rich world, vast amounts of textual data are generated daily across various domains, including news, research, social media, and more. Reading and analyzing lengthy documents can be time-consuming, leading to the need for systems that can automatically generate concise summaries while retaining the essential information. This is especially useful for applications like content aggregation, document understanding, and data compression.

Problem: Given a piece of text (e.g., an article, document, or report), the task is to develop a system that can automatically summarize the input by reducing its length while preserving key information, coherence, and readability. The summary should provide the core meaning of the original text without omitting critical details or introducing inconsistencies.

Challenges:

    Content Selection: Identifying the most important parts of the text while discarding non-essential information.
    Coherence and Fluency: Ensuring the summary reads naturally and maintains logical flow.
    Length Control: Adjusting the summary length based on user preferences or specific constraints (e.g., word or character limits).
    Handling Diverse Domains: Summarizing different kinds of text, such as technical reports, news articles, and conversational transcripts, each of which has unique characteristics.
